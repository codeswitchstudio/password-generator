# password-generator

## Description
This is an application for generating a random password based on the user's preferred length (between 8-128 characters) and selected character sets (namely, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters). This will run in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. I aim to make a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
